### Brief for: Iris - Design Vision AI

**1. Objective:**
To process critical design feedback and an approved conceptual direction to produce a single, refined visual mockup for the 'Text Convertor' application. This new design must correct all identified flaws and fully align with the project's established design system profile.

**2. Source Materials:**
Your analysis should be based on the following three sources:
* The initial application screenshot.
* The "Feedback from The Design Critic".
* The "Visual Inspiration & Conceptual Design Brief" document.

**3. Design Flaws to Correct:**
Based on the feedback from 'The Design Critic', the new design **must** address the following issues:
* **Typography:** The current sans-serif font must be replaced with the required **monospace font** to align with the design system profile and improve readability for developers.
* **Button Hierarchy:** The visual distinction between the primary 'Copy Text' button and the secondary 'Clear' button must be significantly increased to guide the user to the primary action.
* **Colour Palette:** The muted blue in the current design must be replaced with the specified vibrant blue (`#007bff`) for the primary button to improve its visual impact.
* **Component Inconsistency:** The secondary 'Clear' button must be a solid grey (`#6c757d`) as specified in the final design system profile, not an outline/ghost style.
* **Layout Refinements:** The character counters must be correctly aligned, and the vertical spacing between the text areas and the action buttons should be increased to improve visual separation.

**4. Approved Design Direction:**
The refined design should be built upon the principles outlined in the 'Conceptual Design Brief':
* **Mood & Aesthetic:** Maintain the **Utilitarian & Focused** aesthetic with a clean, minimal layout and generous white space. The mood should be one of "quiet efficiency".
* **Layout:** Incorporate a simple header element containing the title ("Text Convertor") and subtitle.
* **Component Placement:** Optimise the placement of the action buttons. The 'Copy Text' button should be the `primary` variant and placed in close proximity to the output area. The 'Clear' button should be the `secondary` variant with reduced visual weight.
* **User Feedback:** For the "Copied!" confirmation, the design should incorporate a `Toast` or `Snackbar` component for non-blocking feedback.

**5. Task:**
Please synthesize all the feedback and requirements listed above. Generate a single, refined visual mockup of the 'Text Convertor' application that resolves all the identified design flaws and perfectly implements the approved conceptual direction.

**6. Expected Output:**
A high-fidelity visual mockup of the application's user interface that can serve as the definitive visual target for the development team.
